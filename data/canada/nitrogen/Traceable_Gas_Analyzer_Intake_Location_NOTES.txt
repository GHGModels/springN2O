This file is for ERS.

When Intakes are placed in the field, distances to the plot edges
must be measured in order to later estimate fetch values.
 

The simple diagram presented below should help the reader further
understand the Intake_Location file.

All plots have width =  100 m, length = 150 m.


Definitions:

	L_N: distance, in length direction, from the intakes to the
edge North of Intakes.

	W_E: distance, in width direction, from the intakes to the
edge East of Intakes.

Plot 1
Crop = corn
At this time (March, 2004) the true placement of instruments
in the Plot is not known.
Units = [m]
It is assumed that placement, at the beginning of 2000, was
similar to the one that corresponds to year 2004.
In 2000, placement must have changed later in the year
When crop is very tall (corn, for example), towers are
eventually moved to the edge. Again, location of towers is
assumed to be similar to the one reported for 2003 (from Peter
von Bertoldi diagrams of CFI plots).
L_S: distance, in length direction, from the intakes to the
edge South of Intakes.
Only one measurement in width direction and one in length
direction are needed.
