Snow depth from the logbook (cm)
Values correspond to average conditions in each plot
There was a major snowfall on DOY 26, but it isn't seen on DOY 27,
because of blowing wind.  Thus I only put an "intermediate value"
for Plot 4
Put in intermediate values for Day 11, Day 21, Day 33 since major
snowfall those days
PPT. on DOY 64 and DOY 65, put in intermediate value for DOY 64
Trace amounts of snow on DOY 104 
No ppt. data for ec for mar and beyond (ignore this, just a reminder
to Ivan)
ACF added some data in agreement with logbook notes (DOY 2 and 5)
Values beyond DOY 351 are rough guesses. No info in logbook

snow arrived on DOY 006. No data due to unsafe driving condintions
According to logbook, it was snowing on Apr 02-03/05 (heavy at times)
ACF is therefore adding two rows to describe this event (doys 092 and 093).
Stopped measuring/recording snow depths after DOY 118.
Snow that arrived on DOY 328 was melted within several days.
ACF is adding two lines (doy 360 and doy 364) according to logbook
