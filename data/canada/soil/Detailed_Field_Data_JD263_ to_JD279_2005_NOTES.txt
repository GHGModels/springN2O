Read_me file for the detailed soil sampling carried out from Sep 20
to Oct 06, 2005 (ERS)
=====================================================================


Sampling collection:

	Four 3-m2 sampling sites were selected in each plot.
	This is different from sampling for all other dates when six
sites per plot, rather than four, were sampled. In all these other
dates, the approximate location of sites was preserved to maintain
some consistency in the sample_ID used throughout.
	In keeping this overall site layout, samples ID from the
sampling described in this file are:

	Sep 20/06:
		Plot1_Site1.

	Sep 28/05:
		Plot1_Site2.

	Oct 03/05:
		Plot1_Site4 and Plot1_Site5.

	Oct 04/05:
		Plot4_Site2, Plot4_Site3, Plot4_Site5 and Plot4_Site6
		Plot3_Site1, Plot3_Site2, Plot3_Site4 and Plot3_Site5

	Oct 06/05:
		Plot2_Site1, Plot2_Site2, Plot2_Site4 and Plot2_Site5

=====================================================================
IMPORTANT:
	Samples taken from Plot_4 were wrongly ID at first but final
files reported by Ravindra are correct.
=====================================================================

	At each sampling site, exact spot where corn plants had already
been cut in previous sampling was identified. From this spot, 3 plants
(i.e. replicates) were randomly chosen for soil (+ residue) sampling.

	(Details of residue sampling are in a similar file located inside
'\Plant\050920_051006' folder).


	For each replicate at each sampling site, undisturbed soil cores
(0-50 cm) were taken at four different positions/locations (indicated by
capital letters A, B, C and D). These are:
	A - Sampling position identified as "on plant": the plant is cut
at approx. 5 cm from ground level and removed. The "soil probe" is then
placed directly on the plant base and driven to the desired soil depth.
	B - Sampling position midway between plants within the row.
	C - Sampling position 1/4 between rows.
	D - Sampling position 1/2 (or midway) between rows.


	Total number of soil cores was:
		4 plots X 4 sites X 3 replicates x 4 positions = 192.

	Soil sampling on Sep 20/06 was carried out with a Hammer Drill
Sampler. Internal metal sleeve diameter was 7 cm.

	Soil sampling on Sep 28, Oct 03-04 and Oct 06 was carried out
with the Hydraulic Concord Sampler. Internal plastic sleeve diameter
was 3.8 cm.

	All 192 soil cores were brought back to the lab, where they were
partitioned into the 4 sampling depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-50 cm).
For Bulk density determination, soil volume for each depth was estimated  
on a single soil core (rep) but soil weight was measured on the composite
sample. Composite samples = samples from each site (all 3 replicates) were
bulked by depth for each sampling position. All analyses were carried out
on these composite samples.

	The number of soil samples for this date is therefore:
		4 plots x 4 sites x 4 positions x 4 depths = 256.


=====================================================================
Analyses to be carried out:

	(Ravindra Ramnarine, for Prof. Voroney)

Further details on lab processing of samples.

Soil core processing:

 1) Cut soil core into segments (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 cm)
 2) Place segment into a pre-weighed aluminium dish.  
 3) Repeat for all three replicates (composite of plant material, soil and
    rocks)
 4) Determine Wet soil weight (soil+dish)-dish weight= wet soil weight.
 5) Transfer segment to 4.76 mm sieve
 6) Gently crush soil and pick out
	a) Plant litter: fresh and old
	b) Plant residue: stem and roots
 7) Quickly pass segment through sieve; pick out residues and rocks while
    swirling sieve
 8) Collect plant litter and residue into aluminium weighing dish (dry at
    75 degC).
 9) Collect rocks into aluminium weighing dish and weigh.
10) Obtain samples of moist soil (approx. 10 g) for soil moisture content
    determination (MC).
     	a) Oven dry at 105 degC for 2 days
     	b) MC (%) = 100*[(wet soil weight - O.D. weight) / O.D. Weight]
11) Resieve soil material through 2 mm sieve and moisten if necessary.
    Push through plant material.
12) Collect sieved soil and particles > 2 mm ("mineral matter"). Place in
    separate bags and weigh.
13) Collect 100 g of sieved soil and freeze for acid hydrolysis.
14) Collect 25 g of sieved soil and refrigerate for (C) Light and heavy
    fraction analysis.
15) Collect ~ 8 g dry soil (i.e. used for moisture content) for Total
    Organic Carbon (TOC) and dC13 analyses.



Dry soil samples:

 1) Finely grind dry soil samples (approx. 8 g each) using a ball mill
    grinder. Store in glass vials.
 2) Remove inorganic carbonates usign HCl.
 3) These samples will be sent for TOC and delta-13 carbon analyses with
    Mass Spec.



Moist soil samples:

Microbial biomass C & N; inorganic N:

 1) Weigh out 4 samples moist soil (approx. 25 g each)
 2) Place sub-samples in small jars
	a) 2 samples are extracted immediately with 100 ml KCl (by shaking
	   for 1 hour)
	b) 2 samples are fumigated for 24 hours, CHCl3 removed and samples
	   extracted as above.
 3) Filter extracts using Whatman Fibre Glass filter into 100 ml
    snap cap vials
 4) Divide extracts for Organic Carbon (~ 10 ml), Inorganic N (~ 10 ml)
    into 20 ml vials and dC13 of OC (~ 70 ml)
 5) Freeze extracts.
(Total organic carbon (TOC) measured with C analyzer in Les Evans lab.)
(For Inorganic N, thaw out frozen 10 ml samples the night before reading
with TRAACS)
(dC13 measured via Mass Spec analysis, method for preparation of samples
not described here; weigh out quantity based on TOC result)

IMPORTANT: SMB N will not be determined. Carbon dyialisis will be carried
out on those extracts.

PROGRESS REPORT: 
	Jun 02/06: finishing adjusting methodologies described below


Soil Incubation CO2:

 1) Weigh out duplicate 25 g moist samples for each depth.
 2) Place in 100 ml vials and pre-incubate for 7 days
 3) Place in 1.5 L mason jars.
 4) Add 20 ml of 0.5M NaOH traps
 5) Leave for 7 days
 6) Remove NaOH from jar and discard. Place "fresh" NaOH and seal.
 7) Incubate for 14 days
 8) Titrate with 0.25M HCl and precipitate with Strantium chloride.
    Strantium carbonate forms.
 9) Sieve with filter paper
10) Wash repeatedly and dry
11) Weigh out for MS analysis (quantity based on TOC result)


(C) Light and heavy fraction:

 1) Use 25 g of refrigerated moist 2 mm sieved soil in snap cap vials.
 2) Add NaI solution (specific gravity of 1.7 g/cm3)
 3) Shake
 4) Suck off light fraction (aspirated)
 5) What is left is heavy fraction in soil. Spin HF in centrifuge and pour
    off NaI (do not re-use).


Acid hydrolysis:

 1) Defrost frozen soil (100 g)
 2) Reflux overnight with 6M HCl
 	a) Easily hydrolyzable material dissolves
	b) Non-hydrolyzable material is freezed dry and quantity weighed
	   out for Mass Spec analysis


=========================================================================
UPDATE (June 02, 2006):

	Currently a "test-run" of plant and soil samples have been sent
to Saskatchewan for mass spec analysis to determine the quantity of 
sample required, for readings to fall within the range that the mass 
spec reads).
=========================================================================
UPDATE (September 12, 2006)

	Soil sample extractions completed for SMB, N and d13C.
	No work carried out on LF/HF.
=========================================================================
UPDATE (September 26, 2006)

	The following samples sent today to Saskatchewan for MS analysis:

	- ALL corn plant samples
	- Another "test run" of soil samples, since previous soil sample
results were inconclusive.
	- A "test run" of strantium carbonate samples.
=========================================================================
UPDATE (December, 2007)

	MS results are back. Plates 69:84 contain data from depths 1-10,
10-20 and 20-30 cm, for all plots/sites/positions (FUMIGATED samples only).
	Results from deepest soil layer (30-50 cm), sent in Plates 85 and
part of 86, are not back yet.
=========================================================================
UPDATE (March, 2008)

	Litter, root and crown dry weights; soil moisture content; soil
bulk density; soil porosity and % Gravel(>2mm) have been reported by Rav
on March 11, 2008.
